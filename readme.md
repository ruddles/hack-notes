# Hack Notes
These are notes I've taken while working through a variety CTF event.  The repo is split into 2 parts:

- notes.md
- tools folder

## notes.md
[notes.md](notes.md) is a single file with notes on common tools and commands I've used.  This is in a single file to make jumping around and searching easier.

## tools
The [tools folder](tools) contains more comprehensive notes on individual tools.
